<h1>Hi, I'm Charis!<br/>
    <i><a href="https://github.com/charis/Education">Computer Scientist</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/charis-charitsis">Software Engineer</a></i>
</h1>

<p>From my childhood, when I first laid hands on my initial PC, to the present day, my affection for computers, computer science, and software development has been unwavering. I consider myself fortunate to have seamlessly transformed what some might call a "profession" into a genuine hobby.</p><p>While my interests have shifted over the years, my passion has not only endured but has grown. The beauty of Computer Science lies in its self-renewing nature. Interestingly, the apparent impossibility of fully keeping up with the continuous influx of new knowledge serves as my primary motivation. Embracing the perpetual learning curve is not merely a professional necessity; it's a source of personal gratification, rendering each endeavor an exhilarating stride forward in an infinite and enthralling journey.</p>
<p>Over the years, I have derived immense joy from engaging in various captivating projects. Inspired by the enjoyment these endeavors brought me, I've recently chosen to showcase a select few in this personal space of mine.</p>
